This project iscurrently in development mode. 

The idea behind this project was to give myself a means of combining what I have learned with Web Development and apply it to one of my upcoming AWS exams.

It can be difficult to balance studying a lot of different concepts, and so I find it useful to provide a means to remembering and inputting new concepts in an organized fashion. The current schema includes concept name, description, keywords, and exam domain (Cloud Concepts, Security, Technology, and Billing ).
